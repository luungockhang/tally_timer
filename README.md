# ⏰ Tally, Timer, Counter ⚡

## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to **count while doing something** and see **how fast you're doing it**, but don't have a tool to do so, or the tool is too expensive to afford, or you simply don't want to buy or search for it?
And you need to do it **on your PC, locally, untethered from the Internet**?
Is that a task which **does not require speed and accuracy of the timer**, such as translation, learning, tasks that require a long time?
This small PC app will help you!

## How to use?
1. Run gui.py with Python
    If you're using VS Code like me, open "src" folder with Code. View "src/gui.py" and run it.
2. Using the app:
    - Press Start for it to start counting
    - Press Count to count.
    - Press Stop to end counting. This will also save the log in the textbox into a file. (Open with notepad or something to view it)

## Planned features:
1. Add naming function to the logging feature.
2. Implement a timer so you can view how much time has passed in real time.
3. Turn this app into an .exe

# A little backstory
The reason for this... little toy, to exist, was that:
I was translating some Mahjong books into my mother tongue, and I wanted to count the pages I was translating, and see how fast I am doing it.
I couldn't think of a term to search for it. I did not want to search for it.
I wanted to create it. So it was created.
It's also an opportunity to learn more about Tkinter and good practice for Python coding since I'm new to this.

## Thanks for using my app. Feel free to give any feedback or suggestions. Don't forget to give a ⭐ if you like it!
