# Tally, Timer, Counter
Have you ever wanted to **count while doing something** and see **how fast you're doing it**, but don't have a tool to do so, or the tool is too expensive to afford, or you simply don't want to buy or search for it?
And you need to do it **on your PC, locally, untethered from the Internet**?
Is that a task which **does not require speed and accuracy of the timer**, such as translation, learning, tasks that require a long time?

Above was the reason for this... little toy, to exist.
I was translating some Mahjong books into my mother tongue, and I wanted to count the pages I was translating, and see how fast I am doing it.
I couldn't think of a term to search for it. I did not want to search for it.
I wanted to create it. So it was created.
